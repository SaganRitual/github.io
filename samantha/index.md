# Greetings, Fellow Humans!

This is my archive of material from my alter-ego at Quora.com, Samantha Tindall-Paulos. When they caught me sock-puppeting, they
banned me for life. Fair enough, it's there in Da Rules. What caught me off-guard was that when they ban you, they delete all your
content. I was able to salvage a few posts before it all disappeared, some that seemed worth keeping, at the time.

My good friend on Quora, whom I treated very badly, asked very little of me when I offered restitution. If this site ever turns into anything, I'll use it to donate to a charity that he might find relevant.

In the mean time, have fun reading my [confession/farewell](http://saganritual.com/samantha/confession.md) to Quora, just before I was banned.
