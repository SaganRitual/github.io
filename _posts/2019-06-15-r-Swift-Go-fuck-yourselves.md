## Apple's developer doc and the Xcode IDE are an embarrassment.

I used to write C++ code for a living. I like Swift a lot better; I learned it some time around early Swift 3. I've been working on a couple of really challenging projects for a couple of years, mostly enjoying myself.

Mostly.

I am constantly astonished at how hard it can be (often impossible) to get even the simplest questions about Apple's support libraries answered. What ranges of values are meaningful when setting GKGoal parameters? How are GKBehaviors affected by changes in said parameters? What, precisely, is the difference between a physics impulse and a physics force in SpriteKit? How do SKPhysicsJoints behave under different stresses? What is DispatchIO and under what circumstances should I use it? There are no answers to such questions anywhere in the Apple doc, and maddeningly, it seems that I am the only person in human history to have asked such questions.

In these days of Google, we're used to discovering that every single question we will ever ask has been asked by hundreds, thousands of other people. I don't have to get a PhD in git in order to learn how to push a specific commit up to GitHub. I can google it, and ten variations of how to do it will show up, usually all of them on StackOverflow. But somehow, I am forever asking questions about Apple-land that no one has ever asked before, so there's often no help for me out there. I end up black-boxing pretty much everything.

Now, when I went out to /r/Swift to ask my questions, I got the distinct impression that they found my questions to be those of a lazy noob, who can't be bothered to google. Especially when one of them called me a lazy noob who can't be bothered to google, and he got upvoted by everyone in the room. They seemed to think that anyone who had ever stood near an iPhone would know the answers to these questions. So, I usually got abuse "you're lying!", condescension "maybe you should try Javascript", downvotes. On good days, I would get silence, and count my blessings.

## I guess I'm just a pussy.

I got sick of being mistreated. I went and posted a message to /r/Swift, asking for advice on where I can go to get help. I explained the treatment to which I had become accustomed, without exaggeration, without any personal attacks on anyone. Just a straightforward description of my experience, and a request for advice.

The whole room came at me with their teeth out, hostile, making wild assumptions about me and then judging me for those assumptions. I'm a lazy noob. If I'd ever used a debugger, I would know the answers to these questions, so I'm lying about being a programmer. And then of course, the really helpful ones, "you write too goddamned much"--this from a guy who had never read anything I ever wrote until he read this post he was responding to. "Stop with the self-pity", on and on. Not a single person asked me a single question of clarification. They simply assumed.

## Or maybe /r/Swift is comprised of pussies.

What did I do? I complained. Not like a troll, not abusively, I just complained. They came after me casting preposterous aspersions on me, **not a single one of them offering to help in any way**, just punishing me. Severely. From that one conversation, and my few feeble attempts to defend myself, my karma went from around 200 to less than zero.

Because I complained, I've been treated like shit by everyone in the room, and now I can't post to reddit any more without moderator assistance. Well, fuck reddit. I was contributing more to /r/Swift than I was getting back anyway.

So I forgot all about reddit, until a few days ago, when I went to post to a different sub, and was reminded that I have to wait for the moderators. Well, what can I do? Let's dig around in /r/help. As it turns out, /r/help says that if you got drained of your karma, go back to the sub where you got drained, and work it out.

That's exactly what I did. I wrote to clear the air. I don't owe anyone an apology for my post, and really, I don't think I owe anyone an apology for defending myself against their attacks. But I did anyway, I apologized for being less than mature. And I asked for upvotes. I think I saw my karma make it as high as 1.

And then people started downvoting me. And not saying why. A couple of guys stopped by to mock, but that was about it. What the fuck? So, I posted again, asking for guidance on what the fuck I'm doing wrong that's getting me downvotes. Did I get help? No. First answer: *two posts in a row not about Swift, all about yourself, you're not going to find much good will here*. What the fuck? Seriously? Two posts. Not about **me**, about how the fuck to fit into this room. And then some other asshole stopped by to suggest that I shouldn't be a pussy about getting downvotes. Another wildly negative assumption. I don't give a shit about downvotes; I want to post without needing help from the moderators.

And you know, I've been in that sub. I used to contribute (a lot) to it, getting very little in return. And you know, a lot of people post things that have nothing to do with Swift. A lot of people post, asking for advice. Well, I was having trouble figuring out how to navigate the culture of /r/Swift, so where the fuck should I go for help? Apparently not to /r/Swift.

Anyway, I stepped away for a while to recover from the "help" I had been receiving, and when I came back, my karma of 1 had gone deeply negative again.

Summary. I got treated badly in /r/Swift on a regular basis. I complained about it, no one offered to help. I got reamed and downvoted into oblivion. After three months, I went back and followed the reddit instructions for recovering from bad karma. I got a few upvotes, and thanks to all of you who helped. And I got downvotes. I tried to ask for help in not getting downvotes, and I got downvoted into oblivion.

I have never been in a room full of people so ready to assume the absolute worst about someone asking a question. So many who will go out and viciously punish someone for some imagined mistake, without even a hint of explanation. So many people who clearly read only the first sentence of a post, or the last sentence, or every other word, or something--they clearly don't take the time to understand the question. Instead, they seem to pick up a couple of keywords and make up their own question, a grotesque straw man that inflames them to go for blood.

It's your loss. I really did contribute far more to /r/Swift than I ever got back. I deleted my reddit account. And there was much rejoicing in /r/Swift.

I tried to work it out with you guys, and you acted like dicks, every last one of you (except perhaps a few who might have tried to help between the time I logged out and the time I went back to delete my account. But I don't see any reason to believe that you last few were any different from the first hundred.)

I hope none of you guys have kids. Punishment without guidance is really just bullying. And that's what I got from /r/Swift, to a man. Guys, go fuck yourselves.

That's not to say that I wish ill on you. I wish peace and luck to all of you, and may you never find yourself facing a room full of people like yourself.
