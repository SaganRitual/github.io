How to Win The Argument, Part I: Introduction

Shocking though it may seem, there is a way for a couple to discuss their grievances with each other without having a shouting match, without saying things they regret, without feeling miserable afterward. In fact, it's a technique that will usually bring you closer after discussing such issues. Some people call it "Non-violent communication". Others call it "Talking about your feelings". Not nearly enough couples are aware of it, aware of how much easier and loving their relationships could be, if only they didn't wound each other while airing their complaints.

It's easiest to speak in terms of male/female hetero relationships. Everyone else, change the pronouns as applicable. Although in the following example problem, the woman is the aggrieved party, the technique works in either direction, for anyone who has a problem with their partner.

Here's the example: Ms Woman, you have noticed that your man has a tendency to ogle other women whenever you're in public. This really bothers you. You want to punish him for it.

This is where you change course, and your relationship. You'll need to recognize, consciously, that you're becoming upset, and then have a little talk with yourself about your feelings.

In the next post, what you'll say to yourself.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part II: Feelings

This is a continuation of my previous post on how to have an effective and loving conversation about your grievances with your partner. You'll need to read that post first, for context.

We left off just at the moment that you, Ms Woman, have recognized that you're starting to get upset. As soon as you notice, there are two things you must do.

First, take ownership of your feelings. That means, notice that there's nothing inherently wrong with looking down women's shirts. Some women like being ogled sometimes, and some women don't mind a bit if their man wants to get an eyeful. The feelings you're having are your own, caused by who you are and how you perceive the world, not by a universal law being broken.

Second, have your feelings. They're not wrong. You're not in error, and you're not bad. No one can tell you, "You shouldn't feel that way." You can't stop your emotions any more than you can stop digesting your lunch. You have no control over it.

You do have control how you treat your man. Don't punish him. He's done nothing wrong. If you're too upset to talk, then don't talk (gently telling him so is encouraged). But no silent treatment. Your goal now is to find a quiet place where you can be alone for a while. Until then, do what you need to do to take care of yourself, without lashing out.

In the next post, what to do with your alone time.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part III: Preparation

This is a continuation of my series on discussing your grievances with your partner in an effective and loving manner. See my previous posts for the context.

We left off with you, Ms Woman, finding a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts for a while. Take time to look inward, and get clear on the feelings you have when your man checks other women out. Whatever feelings you have, drag them all up. Don't worry about the reasons; you won't need reasons. Just your feelings.

Next, give some careful thought to the thing he does that is causing these feelings. The specific action or behavior. You will need to describe to him what he is doing that bothers you in terms that can't be argued with. If you tell him you're upset over his "ogling", you'll fall into a pointless argument over the definition of "ogling". But if you tell him you're upset over him looking down women's shirts, and that is literally what he's doing, then there won't be an argument. I'll talk later about the case where he doesn't admit it.

In my next post, the woman speaks.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part IV: The Woman Speaks

This is a continuation of my series on discussing your grievances with your partner in an effective and loving manner. See my previous posts for the context.

We left off with you, Ms Woman, having cooled down and thoroughly prepared yourself as described in Part III. Now you're ready to discuss the problem with your man.

Go tell him you need to talk. Having seen you go off by yourself, he's probably expecting it. If he needs to prepare himself somehow, if he needs you to wait a couple of hours, let him take care of himself. When you're both ready, muster up every bit of love and compassion you have for him, sit down with him, hold his hands gently, look into his eyes with love, and tell him your problem along these lines:

My Dearest Love, I need to tell you about a problem I'm having. You're not doing anything wrong. I'm not blaming you for anything. I'm having some feelings that I need to tell you about, and I just need you to listen. I don't need you to fix anything or offer solutions. I just need you to listen.

When you look down women's shirts, I feel [feelings]. That's all.

Ms Woman, that's the end of your speech. Notice that you haven't said anything about him. You haven't called him any names, or maligned his character. You haven't assigned any blame or passed judgment, you haven't punished him. You've simply stated the facts that you've agreed upon already, and told him about a feeling you're having. You've given him a safe a loving space in which to process your comments.

Next, the Man listens.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part V: The Man Listens

This is a continuation of my series on discussing your grievances with your partner in an effective and loving manner. See my previous posts for the context.

We left off with you, Ms Woman, having expressed your feelings to your man in a non-judgmental, calm, loving, and compassionate manner. Here I'll talk about the man's role in the conversation.

The man's primary role is to listen. This will be quite difficult for some. The first difficulty is that listening involves not talking. He must listen (and not talk) while you talk. He must realize that his silence is not an admission of guilt. There is no guilt here, no one has sinned.

The second difficulty is that he must control his urges to tell you that you shouldn't feel like that, tell you that you're wrong or bad to feel like that, or try to logic and reason your emotions away, or explain how the reasons for his behavior nullify your emotions. You're having feelings. You don't need reasons or justifications, and no one can tell you not to have your feelings.

You're not attacking him, so he doesn't need to defend himself. You're not saying he's wrong or bad. You're not saying anything about him. You're not asking him to change anything. He's not "sitting there and taking it", because you're not punishing him. You're just telling him about your inner experience.

Next, the man responds.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part VI: The Man Responds

This is a continuation of my series on discussing your grievances with your partner in an effective and loving manner. See my previous posts for the context.

We left off with the man listening to you, Ms Woman, telling him your feelings as described in Part IV. Note that while he is listening, he will not be talking. He will be thinking about the feelings you describe, accepting that they're real, accepting that the pain of them is real, no matter how unreasonable he might think they are. Even if he thinks ogling is perfectly ok, he will notice that you are hurting. When you have finished your speech, the man will do the following.

He'll take a moment to think about a time in his life when he felt that way, or something like it, and remember how much it sucked. (Men, there's no need to try to feel everything she describes. Pick one; the first one she mentions is probably the most important). Then he'll tell you, Ms Woman, "I get it. I felt that same way (or kind of like that) when so-and-so happened to me." If the man can't identify any similar experience in his lifetime, he will simply think of some time in his life when he felt really bad, and tell you, "I've never felt like that, but I get that it's hard for you."

Next, the glorious finale.

Peace and luck

How to Win The Argument, Part VII: The Glorious Finale

This is a continuation of my series on discussing your grievances with your partner in an effective and loving manner. See my previous posts for the context.

We left off with the man relating to your feelings, Ms Woman. He has thought about your pain, thought about what it's like to feel that pain, and acknowledged its impact.

At this point, the heavens will open, and a band of angels will sing unintelligibly beautiful songs while you embrace each other like never before, your hearts beating in synchrony, a golden future stretching out before you as far as the eye can see.

Your mileage may vary.

Sometimes, just being understood by your partner can erase all of your feelings about the thing they were doing. You suddenly find yourself entirely unaffected by the behavior that used to upset you so much. Again, your results will be unique to you as a couple.
