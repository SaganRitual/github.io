## Hi there! I'm Rob Bishop, professional curmudgeon and all-around horrible person.

I don't really know what I'm going to do with this site. Perhaps I'll start an
inflammatory and divisive blog. There's a big market for those. Or a blog about
my adventures writing software using Apple's Swift programming language.
			
Anyway, for the moment, *Under Construction* and all that.

Peace and luck
