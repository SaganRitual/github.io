<i>Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</i>
(Not my words. I'm following a tutorial. This is about the tenth time I've tried to create a website.)
