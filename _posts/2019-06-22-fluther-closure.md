## I get this itch occasionally.

I logged into fluther.com a few months ago, hoping to continue my online career as evangelist for compassion and unity, something I've been doing in forums for five or six years.

The site doesn't get much traffic, so it's not inundated with people who feel bad about themselves, or are afraid of going to hell, or are letting their SO beat them up, all those people I've been seeking out in the forums, to offer them help and hope. But there's almost no one going to fluther.com, so very few going there with such issues.

Still, there's always unity to be worked on, building bridges between Left and Right, another one of my passions, if only I can find some people who haven't given up yet (maybe difficult on a small site like this). So I asked my usual probing hypotheticals, to draw people out, get them to comment, learn how they think.

As usual, my questions come from my vision of the future for our species. I think humans can go far. I think we can do much better than this, and if we can just get past the next century or so without totally ruining the place, we will indeed do much better. So I ask questions with that future in mind. Needless to say, I usually get a lot more feedback from those on the Left than from those on the Right. But the thing is, I already understand the Left. I don't understand the Right, so they're the ones I need to hear from.

As usual, I reached out to those on the Right, addressing them specifically in my questions, encouraging them to tell me all their thoughts, and managed to get a modicum of engagement from them. Not nearly as much as I would have liked. Often, very short answers, or long answers very short on substance. But I tried to work with them, kept trying to draw them out, kept trying to understand what they were saying.

It never worked, for the simple reason that they weren't saying anything. Consider: I asked whether people would support a kind of guaranteed-minimum-income program. I laid out a sketch and then listed a bunch of questions. And then:

First, this guy, @Jaxk, he's pretty strongly against the idea. And that's fine. But then he makes a bunch of totally baseless, emotional assertions as though I'm just supposed to take his word for it. I would probably have ignored him, but he finished his comment with "Frankly the utopian world you would have is a world I couldn’t live in." And of course, I got triggered. I guess I have a button around this guy, it's the second time he's gotten under my skin. But I keep it cool, give him a bit of a hard time, then throw in some humor, and it fizzles out. Good.

But then @KNOWITALL comes in, totally ad-homming me. Nothing whatsoever of any substance, and a wild assertion along the same lines as those barfed up by @Jaxk. The strange thing is, they both manned the gun without a single attempt at clarification, make sure we're all talking about the same thing, nothing. Attack mode. Shoot first. Ok, so I'll keep looking for other right-leaning people, these two, @Jaxk and @KNOWITALL are obviously not the best and brightest Rs on fluther.com.

Then this guy @kritiper comes along, making glib comments about the hundred thousand (or more) Afghani civilians who died when the US retaliated for 9/11. I point out that I don't think he'd be so glib if it had been 100k Americans who had died, but he doesn't respond to that. Rather, he talks about how there are lots of people in the world, and they're all going to die anyway, blah, blah. I still think he would not be so glib if it had been 100k Americans. But I don't read minds. This @kritiper guy also is more prone to scolding and judgments than he is to giving useful answers. Ok, I'll keep looking for an R who can represent.

@Jaxk comes back at me and starts mind-reading, telling me who I am, what I'm thinking, what I'm trying to accomplish. He claims that I'm proposing this and arguing that, which I'm not -- I challenge him to show me an example of such, and he can't, obviously, because I'm not doing that. He pesters me to answer his "arguments," but he doesn't realize that he's not making any arguments, because I haven't put anything out there for him to argue with.

Just about the time I think @Jaxk is going to stop, I get a message from @Patty_Melt. She comes with her teeth bared too: announcing that she is ready for combat. And then I make a mistake, answering her in good faith, after explaining about curiosity, and refusing to fight with her. I expose some of my thoughts to her and expressed my hope that we will be able to talk at some point. Here's her response:

"You are a liar, a dreamer, and a punk. 
You think your romantic ideals have some validity. 
I asked, out of a desire for fluther, all of us, to see for ourselves if there is anything credible about you. 
You bite your thumb at us. 
I’m not interested in your infantile babbling. 
It is a shame. When you first showed up I thought we had a valuable new member. 
Actually, you are more like a book of poetry. You put a bunch of words out there which you think sound pretty together, but you don’t really bite into anything real."

Now, I'm sure that you people who don't listen will think that I ran away because @Patty_Melt hurt my feelings. You go right ahead and think that. As I've said many times, I don't care what you think of me. I'm doing something that matters. You're not.

I've left fluther.com behind, because the quality of the discourse is appalling. It's like a room full of squabbling six-year-olds. It's the same everywhere; the only problem for me is that the site is so small--there aren't any Rs who are willing to have a conversation; as far as I can tell, there aren't any Rs who even know how. But I'm not giving up. I know there are reasonable Rs and reasonable Ds out there.

To you who mistreated me on fluther.com, I forgive you. I wish peace and luck to all of you. --Rob Bishop / SaganRitual
