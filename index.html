<div class="blurb">
		<h1>Hello? ...World?</h1>
		<h2>I'm Rob Bishop, professional curmudgeon and all-around horrible person.</h2>
		<p>I don't really know what I'm going to do with this site. Perhaps I'll start an
			inflammatory and divisive blog. There's a big market for those. Or a blog about
			my adventures writing software using Apple's Swift programming language. Anyway,
			for the moment, <i>Under Construction</i> and all that.</p>
			<p>Peace and luck</p>
